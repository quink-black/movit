	// sample directly from that.
	//
	// There are two good reasons why you might want to set this:
	//
	//  1. You are sampling more than once from the input,
	//     in which case computing all the previous steps might
	//     be more expensive than going to a memory intermediate.
	//  2. You rely on previous effects, possibly including gamma
	//     expansion, to happen pre-filtering instead of post-filtering.
	//     (This is only relevant if you actually need the filtering; if
	//     you sample 1:1 between pixels and texels, it makes no difference.)
	//
	// Note that in some cases, you might get post-filtered gamma expansion
	// even when setting this option. More specifically, if you are the
	// first effect in the chain, and the GPU is doing sRGB gamma

	//   2. Try to sample between texels.
	//   3. Sample with an x- or y-derivative different from -1 or 1.
	//      (This also means needs_mipmaps() and one_to_one_sampling()

	// 1:1-correspondence between input and output texels, e.g. SaturationEffect.
	// However, more creative things, like mirroring/flipping or padding,
	// would also be allowed.
	//
	// The primary gain from setting this is that you can sample directly
	// from an effect that changes output size (see changes_output_size() below),
	// without going through a bounce texture. It won't work for effects that
	// set sets_virtual_output_size(), though.

	//
	//  1. It needs to be an Input, ie. num_inputs() == 0.

	// Note that setting this can invoke undefined behavior, up to and including crashing,
	// so you should only use it if you have deep understanding of your entire chain
	// and Movit's processing of it. The most likely use case is if you have an input
	// that's cheap to compute but not a single texture (e.g. YCbCrInput), and want
	// to run a ResampleEffect directly from it. Normally, this would require a bounce,
	// but it's faster not to. (However, also note that in this case, effective texel
